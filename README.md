350+ tests and growing.

Technical decisions:
- descriptive variable names
- using space to improve time complexity
- iterative solutions over simple recursion
- multiple recursion if algorithm naturally branches
- throwing errors over silently failing on incorrect inputs and edge cases
- using conditional statements to avoid code rather than to wrap code
- giving users access to class properties
- ES6+ features
- AAA testing pattern (Arrange -> Act -> Assert)
