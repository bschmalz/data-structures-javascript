Technical decisions (some exceptions where appropriate):
- prefer verbose variable/function names
- prefer trading space for faster time
- prefer iterative solutions over simple recursion
- prefer multiple recursion over iterative solutions for branching algorithms
- prefer throwing errors over silently failing on incorrect inputs
- prefer latest features over ES5 compliance
- follow AAA (Arrange -> Act -> Assert) testing pattern
