Documentation coming soon once I decide to play with jsdoc converter.

Technical decisions (rules of thumb with some exceptions where appropriate):
- prefer readability over shorter variable/function names
- prefer additional space for faster time
- prefer while loops over simple recursion
- prefer recursion for branching algorithms over iterative solutions
- prefer throwing errors over silently failing on incorrect inputs or use cases
- prefer latest features over ES5 compliance
- follow AAA (Arrange -> Act -> Assert) testing pattern
