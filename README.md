400+ tests.

Technical decisions:
- prefer descriptive, verbose identifiers
- prefer extra space to improve time complexity
- prefer iterative solutions over simple recursion
- prefer multiple recursion if algorithm naturally branches
- prefer throwing errors over silently failing on incorrect inputs and edge cases
- prefer using conditional statements to avoid code rather than to wrap code
- prefer ES6+ features
- give users access to class properties

Tests use AAA testing pattern (Arrange -> Act -> Assert). This library has full coverage for all structures and their public methods.
