Technical decisions (some exceptions where appropriate):
- prefer descriptive variable names
- prefer trading space to improve time complexity
- prefer iterative solutions over simple recursion
- prefer multiple recursion if algorithm naturally branches
- prefer throwing errors over silently failing on incorrect inputs and edge cases
- prefer latest features over ES5 compliance
- follow AAA (Arrange -> Act -> Assert) testing pattern
